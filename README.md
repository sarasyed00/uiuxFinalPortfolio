# uiuxFinalPortfolio

I created this site as my final project in an upper level UI/UX course I took at Brown. Since then I have made some minor tweaks to the site. The site is a portfolio of the projects I completed in the class. I found this final project to be a great way to experiment with design, as well as strengthen my HTML, CSS, and React skills. I had a lot of fun making a very playful portfolio, and learned a lot about my interests in designing for accessibility, which I've continued to explore more via Human Computer Interaction research.
